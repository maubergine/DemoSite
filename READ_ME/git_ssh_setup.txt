1.  Download git from http://git-scm.com/downloads.
2.  Install using default settings.
3.  Open Git bash (in the folder where you have installed Git).
4.  Create your SSH public/private key pair by entering the following (press return after each instruction):
    a)  ssh-keygen -t rsa
    b)  Don't enter a filename.
    c)  Enter a memorable passphrase.
    Should now be done!

In Eclipse:

5.  Go to Window-->Preferences-->General-->Network Connections-->SSH2
6.  Change SSH2 home to wherever Git bash has created the SSH files.
7.  Go to the Key Management tab.
8.  Click Load Existing Key... and select id_rsa.
9.  In your innersource dashboard go to Manage SSH keys-->Add SSH Key.
10. Paste the text visible in the Eclipse preference into the box and hit Save.

11. If you have a version of Eclipse earlier than Juno you may need to install the Git plugin (go to Help-->Eclipse marketplace and Search).
12. Go to Window-->Open Perspective-->Other-->Git Repository Exploring.
13. Clone a Git repository.
14. Paste the project URI (git@innersource.accenture.com:pol-ecom/master.git) and set the protocol as ssh
15. Click Next >
16. Select the branch you want to clone.
17. Pick any destination directory - D:\dev\repos\pol-ecom\ is recommended just in case.
18. Import all the projects via the checkbox if you want, otherwise you can select from the Working Directory folder once cloning is complete.


That should be everything!
